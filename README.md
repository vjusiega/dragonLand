# dragonLand
Mid and final project for AP Computer Science. Working in an original team of six for our mid-year project (found in the master branch), 
and then a group of four for our final project (found in master2.0 branch) my team and I created a virtual dragon petland where users can
buy, sell, trade, feed, and play a minigame with dragons. In our final project my partner Tamanna and I self-taught ourselves the 
principles of computer networking. Using simple sockets we created an application within our game in which a user can trade dragons with 
another user over a closed network.
